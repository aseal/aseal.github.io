        The Quikest way to find out if a number is power of 2: <br />
            n == (n &amp (n-1))<br />
        This is so easy to comprehend, but I managed to forget it in few occasions. So, thought of putting it out.

        <p>Presented "Introduction to SDN" today. I always find it hard to assimilate control plane virtualization with overlay. In my mind these are two different topics which have completely different purposes, design and implementation semantics. In control plane , we are managing the network sitting in middle of it, whereas in overlay we are slicing the network from an upper layer. I don't think vxlan and SDN controller can be put under same umbrella. May be, there is something that I don't quite understand yet, or may be not.</p>

		<p>How to find the longest path (diameter) in a tree? For, binary tree, this can be achieved by recursively vising left and right nodes and calculating their diameters (<a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/diameter-of-a-binary-tree/">link</a>). For, n-ary tree, we can use brute-force and run bfs/dfs on all nodes recording the max distance. But there is a very efficient way.</p>
			<ul class="dash">
				<li>Run BFS/DFS on any node to find the farthest leaf node.</li>
				<li>Run BFS/DFS again on the previously found farthest node.</li>
				<li>The longest path from the second run is the diameter of a tree</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The main idea here is that, the farthest point found in BFS/DFS starting from any node is actually one of the nodes in one of the longest paths. If you are looking for proof, you can find it <a href="http://www.quora.com/How-does-following-algorithm-for-finding-longest-path-in-tree-work">here</a>.</p>

		<p>I completed the configuration of dnsmasq. But, it is still not integrated with my router. Now, I'm extra-cautious not to get locked-out on my DNS server <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>. I've quite a few plans on this project, I'm hoping to try more challenging stuff soon.</p>

        <p>I've been looking for an efficient way to download videos from youtube. I used the sites - <a href="en.savefrom.net">en.savefrom.net</a> and <a href="keepvid.com">keepvid.com</a>. Finally came across youtube-dl. Voil√† !! Now I can download youtube videos from command prompt, just like wget - I'm loving it. Here are some examples of what you can do -</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>List available formats</td>
                <td>youtube-dl -F <url></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Download in a specific format from above list</td>
                <td>youtube-dl -f 22 <url></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Download best audio and video quality</td>
                <td>youtube-dl -f bestaudio+bestvideo <url></td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>I'm taking part in Borathon (Hackathon) in VMWare. It starts today. Friday we will demo our work. We are working on - "File based Backup Restore for Cloud Storage".</p>

        <h2>Dec 18, 2015</h2>
        <p>In my opinion, we did quite well in Borathon, but, unfortunately, judges didn't agree :( Any way, we had lots of fun. We learnt a lot - built a product from an idea in just ~40 hrs.</p>

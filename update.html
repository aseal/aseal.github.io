        <p>I had to start early from work as my wife had a rehearsal and I had to baby seat. It was 5:30 pm - should not actually be called early - but, bay area traffic has changed our work hours. In bay area, the recommended office hours are 11 am to 7 pm or later. If you try to be early, you will be penalized by "time out" in your car for at least half an hour. Any way, looking at traffc, I turned on waze - hoping waze will find ways to get me out of this parking lot. I took 280S and merged to 85S and came close to De Anza. It was stop and crawl (by inches) throuout. Just before De Anza, Waze had a change of heart - it sprung to life and declared "We got it" take exit and take 85N and 280S. Basically it wanted me to go in the reverse direction and continue 280S. So, theoritically it is possible that Waze can potentially put you in a loop, if traffic condition keep on changing frequently. Funy <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>.</p>

        <p>Presented "Introduction to SDN" today. I always find it hard to assimilate control plane virtualization with overlay. In my mind these are two different topics which have completely different purposes, design and implementation semantics. In control plane , we are managing the network sitting in middle of it, whereas in overlay we are slicing the network from an upper layer. I don't think vxlan and SDN controller can be put under same umbrella. May be, there is something that I don't quite understand yet, or may be not.</p>

		<p>How to find the longest path (diameter) in a tree? For, binary tree, this can be achieved by recursively vising left and right nodes and calculating their diameters (<a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/diameter-of-a-binary-tree/">link</a>). For, n-ary tree, we can use brute-force and run bfs/dfs on all nodes recording the max distance. But there is a very efficient way.</p>
			<ul class="dash">
				<li>Run BFS/DFS on any node to find the farthest leaf node.</li>
				<li>Run BFS/DFS again on the previously found farthest node.</li>
				<li>The longest path from the second run is the diameter of a tree</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The main idea here is that, the farthest point found in BFS/DFS starting from any node is actually one of the nodes in one of the longest paths. If you are looking for proof, you can find it <a href="http://www.quora.com/How-does-following-algorithm-for-finding-longest-path-in-tree-work">here</a>.</p>

		<p>Got some time today after office. Got the picture section up. I felt reeally good. There are some days, when things just happen without much effort. Although, most of my days are of opposite types <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i></p>

        <h2>Aug 2, 2015</h2>
		<p>Today we went to Pleasantan to meet some friends. Had a good time and LOTs of good food.</p>
		<p>BTW, I should mention why am I writing this stuff here. There are two main objectives:</p>
			<ul class="dash">
				<li>to take a note of the memorable events of the day.</li>
				<li>try to do something worth mentioning every day.</li>
			</ul>
		<p> I'm still trying this out. I don't know if this would be sustainble thing. We will see.</p>


        <h2>Aug 1, 2015</h2>
		<p>Went to one of my friend's b'day (LOL)party. It was very nice gathering, and awesome food .. very relaxing. Zoya had a great time too.</p>
		<p>Finally got my website up. I tried and failed many times in the past. It felt like an impossible task to design and maintain a website, which I can actually like. Finally, I got Bootstrap - this is the right amount of abstraction for my need. Now I can focus on the design and code which really matters to me. Kudos to Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton !!! I think, this is a giant leap towards simplifying web design.</p>

        <h2>July 31, 2015</h2>
		<p>Today I got locked out with my daughter without phone, wallet and keys. We had a nice daddy and daughter homeless adventure for few hours. It got me thinking about another aspect of life.</p> 
		<p>On technical front, I completed the configuration of dnsmasq. But, it is still not integrated with my router. Now, I'm extra-cautious not to get locked-out on my DNS server <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>. I've quite a few plans on this project, I'm hoping to try more challenging stuff soon.</p>

        <h2>July 30, 2015</h2>


        <p>Today I went to VMware intern poster presentation. I was feeling very nostalgic. In my school days, I used to participate in many science exhibitions. I should go to this kind of presentations more often. It reminds me that there are so many things to do, and all the things are not that difficult. I'm not sure, if I can share anything about the demos here. So holding my temptation.</p>
